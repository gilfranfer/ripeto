# Welcome to Ripeto! - Version 0.1
Track and Control your Repetitive Activites

Some people have activities that want to incorporate as part of their normal day. 
Repetition is the key to make that activiti a habit on your life.

Use Ripeto to setup the list of activities and establish a time in your day for them and a recurrence. We will refresh your list of activities every day, and you just need to mark them as done or ignore.
Ripeto will use the data generated by your interactions to show your your progress and help you to re organize your activities.

# Current Features:

- Register

Create a new user with your email. Email confirmation is not used at this point, but using a real email is encouraged. Future versions will include password recovery that can be accomplished only if you have access to the provided email account.

- Authentication

After Registration, you will be automatically authenticated. You can logout and login back with your email and password.

- Create Tasks

The core idea of this simple application is to create tasks. Just type the task name on the "Search/Create" box and push the + button. If you want to place the task in an specific list, just select the list before clicking the + button. 
It is possible to add a Due Date to your tasks, using the date picker located below the "Search/Create" box. 

- See Tasks

In the main page you will see all your tasks for the selected list. Changing the list will update the tasks to show. You can use "order by" to re-organize the display of your tasks.
Tasks with a due date will be displayed using red color font.
From here you will be able to "Close your tasks", and open the task details.Closed task will be displayed in another section at the bottom.  From there you can permanently delete a task or put it back in your open tasks.

- Check Tasks Details

You can open the task details for more information. Currently you can add comments on the task and modify the task name or list from there. We will be adding more things there.

- Create or Remove Lists

There is always a Default list to place your tasks. If you need to add your own lists, just click the "List" button, below the "Search/Create" box and you will get a popup window to add your new list.
You can delete your existing lists anytime using the same popoup window. Keep in mind that the "Default" list cannot be deleted. If you happen to delete a list that already has tasks associate, all those tasks will be automatically moved to the "Default" list.
